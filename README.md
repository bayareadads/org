### FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

#### How do I join the group?
- easy! click to join [Bay Area Dads Slack](https://bayareadads.herokuapp.com/) (alternate [backup link](http://hamsterpad.com/chat/bayareadads))

#### Do I have to be a dad to join?
- No, but it helps. This is a group for dads and dads-to-be. We've found that there are dozens of groups for moms in the bay area. This one is really intended for dads. If you want to lurk, we won't necessarily kick you out, but if you're not a dad, you probably will be VERY BORED here.

#### Do I have to live in (San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, etc.) to be here?
- Not at all, we're just focused on life in the Bay Area and how that
  affects birth, pregnancy, parenting, schooling, and our lives. We have
  members who used to live in the Bay Area but moved, and people who are
  moving to the Bay Area but haven't landed yet. Like SF, this is a
  "live and let live" group.

#### Can I invite my friend(s)?
- Yes, send them the link! We also just printed some SWEET invitation cards for when you meet someone at the playground and don't have the link handy. Ask jm3 for some.

#### Is there a B.A.D. code of conduct?
- There is! Please obey it and help everyone have a safe + chill time.

##### Code of Conduct
- Be friendly and patient
- Be welcoming
- Be considerate
- Be respectful
- Be careful in the words you choose

Violators of this code will be banned and/or made to step on LEGO until they cry.

#### When is the next meet-up?

#### Can you help me find a doctor / specialist / babysitter?
- Probably! You can check our [wiki of resources](https://github.com/bayareadads/org/wiki), or inquire in Slack.

#### I have an idea for a dads hack-session / skate session / BBQ / other!
- Great! We are always looking for new organizers, mentors, and helpers. Raise your hand in Slack.

##### Who is "in charge" here?
- No one really, but this was started by [jm3](http://twitter.com/jm3)
  and grew from there.
