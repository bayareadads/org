#### Do I have to be a dad to join?
- No, but it helps. This is a group for dads and dads-to-be. We've found that there are dozens of groups for moms in the bay area. This one is really intended for dads. If you want to lurk, we won't necessarily kick you out, but if you're not a dad, you probably will be VERY BORED here.

#### Do I have to live in (San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, etc.) to be here?
- Not at all, we're just focused on life in the Bay Area and how that
  affects birth, pregnancy, parenting, schooling, and our lives. We have
  members who used to live in the Bay Area but moved, and people who are
  moving to the Bay Area but haven't landed yet. Like SF, this is a
  "live and let live" group.

#### Is there a B.A.D. code of conduct?
- There is! Please obey it and help everyone have a safe + chill time.

##### Code of Conduct
- Be friendly and patient
- Be welcoming

##### Who is "in charge" here?
- No one really, but this was started by [jm3](http://twitter.com/jm3)
  and grew from there.
